# Snippets UI

In our daily projects, elements like arrows, flags and custom labels are very common. At first glance, using an image would be the best solution, however, we lose in performance, customization, maintenance and CSS effects, like transitions and animations.

This project aims to make easier the creation of these elements using **only css**.
